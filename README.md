# Grid Designer

Grid Designer is a simple browser-based tool that lets you create 2D designs on a grid, similar to graph paper. You can color individual grid line segments, add draggable text, and export your work as a landscape PDF.

## Features

* **Grid System**: A grid with small squares for precise design.
* **Segment Coloring**: Click on the edge of any square to color or uncolor that segment.
* **Color Picker**: Choose custom colors for grid segments.
* **Text Boxes**: Add draggable, editable text with adjustable font family, size, and color.
* **Snap-to-Grid**: Both line segments and text snap neatly to the grid for alignment.
* **Undo/Redo**: Keep track of your design history and easily step backward or forward.
* **Export to PDF**: Save your full design in A4 landscape format.

## Usage

1. Open the `index.html` file in your browser.
2. Use the toolbar to:

   * Pick a line color.
   * Add and format text.
   * Undo or redo actions.
   * Export your final design as a PDF.
3. Click on grid edges to color them.
4. Add text boxes, drag them into place, and type your text.
5. Export to PDF when your design is finished.

## Requirements

No installation required â€” just open the HTML file in any modern browser.

The project uses:

* [html2canvas](https://html2canvas.hertzen.com/) for rendering HTML to canvas.
* [jsPDF](https://github.com/parallax/jsPDF) for PDF generation.

## Example

Design something like architectural sketches, pixel art, or schematic-like diagrams directly in your browser.
